1) Why _another_ burning frontend??
############################################################

texburn is for console freaks. But for those that love comfort ;)
It is all without fancy menus and you don't have to use a mouse
to click yourself through endless dialogs.
The program was designed to work as automatic as possible.
It should do the work, not you.

You just type e.g. "texburn grab audio" and it rips your cd and renames the tracks accordingly via cddb,
or "texburn copy" to copy a cd,
or "texburn /archive/music/metal/stratovarius/elements" to burn the oggs or mp3s within that directory directly as an audio cd.

It's just simple as that.



2) Features
############################################################

- Suport for audio and data cds (single files, directories or ISO images)
- Support for BIN and CUE images
- Copy audio or data CDs
- Blank media (CDRr or CDRWs) fast or completely
- Rip data CDs as a directory or ISO image
- Rip audio CDs with automatic encoding in your favorite format
  (mp3 or ogg) and rename the tracks automatically via cddb
- Burn pls (xmms) or m3u (winamp) playlists directly as audio cd
- Easy-to-use interface
- Highly configurable with the help of a config file
- Dialog menus only when user interaction is necessary
- Automatic detection of parameters/arguments



3) Features to come
############################################################

- MultiSession support
- Multiple parameter detection
- Automatic conversion of videos and burning as (s)vcd ???



4) Installation and required software
############################################################

To install the program, simply copy the script file 'texburn' to /usr/sbin
(or use `make install'). Then read the README completely and create a
config file.

Please be aware that almost every required program may already be installed
with your distribution, or is available directly from your distribution cd or
download site. (RPMs: rpmfind.net; Debian: apt-cache search)
The following is a list of the required software.

- cdda2wav -- required for ripping audio cds (http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/cdda2wav/)
- cdrecord -- required for burning cds (http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html)
- mkisofs  -- creates ISO images (http://www.andante.org/mkisofs.html)
- ogg123   -- decode ogg audio files (http://www.vorbis.com)
- mpg123   -- decode mp3 audio files (http://www.mpg123.de)
- cdrdao   -- required for burning BIN/CUE images (http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/download.html)
- dialog   -- user interaction
- lame     -- encode mp3 audio files (http://lame.sourceforge.net/)
- oggenc   -- encode ogg audio files (http://www.vorbis.com)
- cda      -- retrieve cddb information - this programm is included in the xmcd package (http://www.downseek.com/download/3528.asp)



5) Usage
############################################################

Start texburn with one parameter. This can be a file or a directory.
Multiple paramters are _not_ supported yet (e.g. `texburn *.mp3')
For example, the following commands are all valid and pretty much self-explanatory:

texburn isoimage.img               texburn isoimage.iso
texburn binimage.bin               texburn binimage.cue
texburn mysong.mp3                 texburn mysong.ogg
texburn mysong.wav                 texburn /home/me/a_data_dir
texburn myfavoritesongs.m3u        texburn myfavoritesongs.pls
texburn /mymusic/an_album 


There are a few additional commands:

texburn [-h|--help|help]       -- display a short help
texburn [-h|--version|version] -- display the program version
texburn copy                   -- display a menu: copy data or audio cd
texburn copy [audio|audiocd]   -- copy an audio cd without user interaction necessary
texburn copy [data|datacd]     -- copy a data cd without user interaction necessary
texburn blank                  -- display a menu: blank a medium fast or completely
texburn blank fast             -- blank a medium fast (recommended)
texburn blank [all|complete]   -- blank a medium completely
texburn grab                   -- display a menu: grab a data or an audio cd
texburn grab [audio|audiocd]   -- grab an audio cd (set the format (ogg/mp3/wav) in the config file
                                  (see also section 6))
texburn grab [data|datacd]     -- display a menu to grab a cd as a directory or as an ISO image



6) Configuration file
############################################################

Create a file `/etc/texburnrc' or `$HOME/.texburnrc' (should be in /root, as you have
to log in as root to use the program).
See the example config file for an idea how it can look like.

Use the hash (#) at the _beginning_ of a line to comment that line out.
Do not include spaces around the equal sign (type `cdrecord=/usr/bin/cdrecord', not
`cdrecord = /usr/bin/cdrecord').


Available config options:

device=x,y,z                Set your cdrecorder SCSI device settings (chan,id,lun).
                            Find them out using `cdrecord -scanbus' or `cat /proc/scsi/scsi'.

speed=x                     Set the speed at which CDs should be recorded.

cdrom=<path to device>      This is where your cdrom is located (for copying or grabbing).

tempdir=<directory>         The required temp directory. Default is `/tmp/texburntemp'
                            Expect it to require MUCH free disk space (for ISO images etc), so
                            your /tmp partition should have enough free space available. If not,
                            specify another directory here!
                            WARNING: Do _NOT_ set this to your home dir (use a subdirectory!), since
                            this directory will be rm -rf'ed automatically at program exit.

ripoutput=<directory>       This is the place where grabbed CDs go (audio and data).

format=<ext>                Your favorite audioformat output when using `texburn grab audio'.
                            Can be mp3, ogg or wav.

lameopts=<whatever>         The (audio quality) options when encoding mp3s using lame.

oggencopts=<whatever>       The (audio quality) options when encoding oggs using oggenc.

owner=tex.tex               When you rip an audio cd for example, the output will be `chown'ed
                            afterwards. Set this to your normal user name and default group.

pad=<yes|no>                If set to `yes', audio cd burning will use the -pad switch for cdrecord,
                            `no' will use -dao. Not all cd recorders support the -dao switch, therefore
                            the recommended value is `yes'. (See `man cdrecord' for details)

forcetools=<yes|no>         If set to `yes', the check for the required tools is disabled.
                            It is recommended that you keep this value at `no'.

burnproof=<yes|no>          If set to `yes`, the support for Buffer Underrun Free writing is enabled
                            in cdrecord. This only works for drives that support Buffer Under-
                            run Free technology. This may be called: Sanyo BURN-Proof, Ricoh Just-Link, 
                            Yamaha Lossless-Link or similar.
